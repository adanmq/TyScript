	This function allows for multi-threaded particle 
	scripting. It is disabled by default. To switch to threaded 
	mode, call 'tf.SetThreaded(true);' in 'simulationStart'.

	The arguments 'startInx' and 'endInx' point to the start
	and end index of a chunk of event particles that each 
	thread will process in parallel.

	The argument 'threadInx' is the index of the current thread.

	If you want to have simulationStepThreaded evaluate multiple
	times in the same time step (ex: you are multithreading an 
	iterative solver), you can call tf.SetThreadedIterations(n) to
	set the number of times the threads will re-evaluate this function.
	The iterator will wait for all threads to complete their tasks 
	before starting the next iteration. tf.GetThreadedIteration() 
	can	be called to determine the current iteration of the 
	iteration loop.

	Please make sure you understand the limits of 
	multithreading in 3dsmax before enabling this feature!
